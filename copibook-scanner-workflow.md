This document serves as a guide for digitization practices supporting the American Philosophical Society’s digital initiatives. These efforts are part of a broader commitment to preserving and providing access to the Society’s collections through the use of Islandora and Drupal platforms. Specifically, this guide is intended to assist project staff in the use of the CopiBook OS XD Book Scanner to produce high-quality digital surrogates of original materials.

This document will be updated as needed to reflect changes in software, hardware, or digitization standards.
